🧠 FIRST: WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW (BASELINE)

You already have Level-0 correctness, which most people never reach:

✅ PPO trading agent
✅ Portfolio-value reward (no reward hacking)
✅ CNN + LSTM encoder
✅ Stable training & evaluation
✅ Realistic trade frequency

👉 This is your baseline system.
Everything else is an incremental experiment on top of this.

🗺️ MASTER PLAN (ORDER + TIME)

You will do this in 5 phases.
Each phase produces publishable results.

🔵 PHASE 1 — WALK-FORWARD & REGIME TESTING

⏱ Time: 1–1.5 weeks

What you do

Split data into:

Train: T1

Test: T2 (never touched during training)

Define regimes:

Trending (high EMA slope)

Sideways (low volatility)

Volatile (high ATR)

Evaluate same trained policy on each regime

Why this is critical

Proves generalization, not memorization.

Output

Table: PnL, trades, drawdown per regime

Equity curves per regime

📌 This alone is research-paper worthy.

🟣 PHASE 2 — RISK-AWARE OBJECTIVE

⏱ Time: 1 week

What you do

Modify reward:

reward = Δ portfolio_value − λ × drawdown


or

reward = Sharpe_proxy


Train with different λ values.

Why quants care

Profit without risk control is meaningless.

Output

Risk-return tradeoff curves

Comparison vs risk-neutral PPO

📌 This turns your system into a quant model, not ML demo.

🔴 PHASE 3 — MULTI-ASSET SHARED POLICY

⏱ Time: 1.5–2 weeks

What you do

Train one PPO agent

Across multiple stocks

Add asset-ID embedding

State becomes:

[state_features, asset_embedding]

Why this is huge

Shows transfer learning & distributional thinking

This is extremely rare in student projects.

Output

Performance per asset

Cross-asset generalization analysis

🟠 PHASE 4 — EXECUTION & MICROSTRUCTURE MODELING

⏱ Time: 1 week

What you add

Execution delay (1–3 timesteps)

Slippage proportional to volatility

Partial fills

Why HFT firms care

Decision ≠ execution.

Even simple modeling here shows maturity.

Output

Performance degradation vs latency

Robustness analysis

🟡 PHASE 5 — ABLATION & STATISTICAL TESTS

⏱ Time: 1 week

What you test

CNN vs CNN+LSTM

Raw prices vs indicators

PPO vs momentum baseline vs random

Report

Mean returns

Std dev

Confidence intervals

📌 This is paper-level discipline.

⏱️ TOTAL REALISTIC TIMELINE
Phase	Time
Walk-forward & regimes	1–1.5 weeks
Risk-aware reward	1 week
Multi-asset	1.5–2 weeks
Microstructure	1 week
Ablation & stats	1 week
TOTAL	6–7 weeks

This is very reasonable for a serious project.

📝 BLOG STRUCTURE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Your blog is NOT the paper.

Blog tone:

Story-driven

Engineering-focused

Honest failures

Blog sections:

Why most RL trading projects fail

Reward hacking (and how I fixed it)

Why portfolio-value reward matters

What quants actually care about

Lessons learned

📌 Blogs like this get read by quants.

🎓 WHAT THIS PROJECT SAYS ABOUT YOU

By the end, you can honestly say:

“I built a risk-aware reinforcement-learning trading system, evaluated under regime shifts, multi-asset generalization, and execution constraints, with statistically validated results.”

That sentence alone is elite for a 2nd-year student.

🚨 IMPORTANT RULES (DO NOT BREAK THESE)

❌ Don’t chase profits
❌ Don’t tune hyperparameters endlessly
❌ Don’t add transformers prematurely
❌ Don’t fake results

✅ Show correctness
✅ Show discipline
✅ Show thinking

Quants care about how you think, not how much money you made.
